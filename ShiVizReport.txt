Our visualized election is run on 9 nodes with a timeout value of 1 second, an AYA timeout of 10s and a droplevel of 5%. Right after system initialization there is a time out, and coincidently the lowest node calls for an election. Which causes a huge cascade of rippling messages up to the top node, intermittent with answers being sent back to electing nodes. Node 003 never receives a coordinator message and eventually times out calling another election. What makes this particular election interesting is how sparse it is. N003 is only able to successfully send out 3 ELECT messages, luckily one gets to the highest level node, and the system levels out quickly. After that point the whole system acts in a more predictable way with the coordinator answering all of it is AYA messages. The system then runs a series of small elections among the higher nodes which are quickly settled.
