[25/25] TA Interview
      Discussions and responses to the following areas:
      * Interoperability Experience
      * Usage of ShiViz - what did you use it for, what was your experience
         when did it help, what you found interesting/confusing about it
      * Threads vs event driven implementation, was it considered why 
        did you choose what you did. 
      * Various election scenarios, what would happen with two simultaneous
        elections, failure scenarios etc.
      * The specified protocol packet had an election ID field, is it 
        required for proper operation?
